# Machine Learning – Regression Models in Python

## Objective
Compare two regression models (Linear Regression vs Random Forest) to determine which one provides the best predictive performance on a structured dataset.

This project demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing
- Training two regression models
- Model evaluation
- Analysis & interpretation
